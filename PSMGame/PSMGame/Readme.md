Extend one of the Sprite Classes to basically be a container that holds a sprite and the references to the physics bodies so it can handle its own updating?
Spritesheet system (though if it turns out that it might take too long, sprite lists should preform well enough for jam purposes)

We should schedule a breakdown of what work we expect to do. Few reasons:
1. Arthur will need time to do audio.
2. Would be nice to be able to pop out during indiecade to see talks we want to see/Night Games (I suggest we all go see Night Games regardless of where we are...)
3. I had other reasons but I can't remember them right now because I honestly should be sleeping long time ago...
